This code is a simple Tkinter GUI (Graphical User Interface) application written in Python. The purpose of the application is to collect and store information about employees. Here's a brief description of what the code does:

1. **GUI Initialization:**
   - The `Tk` class is used to create the main window (`mywin`) for the application.
   - The title of the window is set to "ประวัติพนักงาน" (Employee Information).
   - StringVar objects (`s1` to `s13`) are created to hold the data entered by the user.

2. **Save Function (`save`):**
   - When the user clicks the "บันทึก" (Save) button, the `save` function is called.
   - The function collects data from the Entry widgets and the OptionMenu widgets.
   - It formats the collected data into a string and appends it to a list (`lst`).
   - The list is then written to a CSV file named "บันทึกพนักงาน.csv" using the `csv.writer`.

3. **Search Function (`sh`):**
   - When the user clicks the "ค้นหา" (Search) button, the `sh` function is called.
   - The function reads the content of the CSV file ("บันทึกพนักงาน.csv") and prints each row to the console.

4. **Dropdown Menus and Entry Widgets:**
   - The GUI includes Entry widgets for the user to input data (such as employee ID, name, etc.).
   - Dropdown menus (OptionMenu) are used for selecting titles, gender, religion, marital status, and provinces.

5. **Buttons:**
   - The "บันทึก" (Save) button triggers the save function to store employee information.
   - The "ค้นหา" (Search) button triggers the search function to display the existing employee records.
   - The "ออก" (Exit) button closes the application.

6. **Default Values:**
   - Default values are set for dropdown menus and some Entry widgets.

7. **OptionMenu Callbacks (`selected`, `selected2`, `selected3`, `selected4`, `selected5`):**
   - Callback functions for the OptionMenu widgets to handle the selected values.

8. **Loop (`mywin.mainloop()`):**
   - Finally, the `mainloop` method is called to run the Tkinter event loop, allowing the user to interact with the GUI.

In summary, this code creates a simple employee information recording system with a graphical interface using Tkinter. The user can enter employee details, save them to a CSV file, and search for existing records.
